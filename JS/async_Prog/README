Sync in JS:
SYnchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program.
i.e. Line by Line 
Each instructions waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution. 


Asynchronous in JS:
Due to Asynchronous programming, sometimes important instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in the UI.
Asynchronous code execution allows to execute the next instruction code immediately and doesn't block the code.


Callbacks:
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.

Callback Hell



To Avoid Callback HEll... We use Promise 

let promise=new Promise((resolve,reject)=> {...})
                        function with 2 handlers

        *resolve and reject are callbacks provided by JS

    In Js, Promise is a class.

3 states of promise:-
    >pending state
    >fulfilled state {resolved}
    >rejected state

Suppose an order placed on amazon:
    >pending state (order placed; waiting to recieve the product; online paid; etc)
    >fulfilled state (Order recieved; No problem faced!)
    >rejected state (Order cancelled; Other disputes which not wanted!)
